# File Sharing Web Application Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of our file sharing web application! This application allows users to securely share files with others through a simple and intuitive interface. Our backend is built using Node.js, MongoDB Atlas for database management, Express for handling HTTP requests, and Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development. We've also used HTML and CSS for frontend components and tested our endpoints using the Insomnia API client.

Features

* Secure File Sharing: Users can securely upload files and share them with others using unique download links.
  this was made possible by generating unique UUID for each file that will be uploaded.
* Brevo Integration: The application seamlessly integrates with Brevo's api to send download links to recipients via 
  email.
* Node.js: Built on the Node.js platform, providing a scalable and efficient backend infrastructure.
* Express Framework: Utilizes Express for handling HTTP requests, simplifying routing and middleware management.
* MongoDB Atlas: Database management handled by MongoDB Atlas, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.
* Nodemon: Development made easy with Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server upon file changes.
* HTML & CSS: Simple and elegant user interface crafted with HTML and CSS for a smooth user experience.
* Insomnia Testing: Endpoints thoroughly tested using the Insomnia API client to ensure reliability and functionality before linking with the front end!.
